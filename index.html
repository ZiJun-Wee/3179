          <p>The choropleth map on the right portrays the latest CO2 emissions per capita from 2023. 
            As seen from the projection, the distribution of CO2 per capita is not evenly distributed across
        different countries and different regions. </p>

          <h2>Relationship between non-renewable forms of energy and CO2</h2>
          <p>There is a positive correlation between the use of non-renewable forms of energy(such as fossil fuels) and
            the CO2 emissions. However, income level does not seem to have a relationship with the level of CO2 emissions,
            despite the countries having the means to pursue better ways to produce energy and reduce their CO2 emissions.

            <h2>Global energy consumption breakdown</h2>
            <p>There is a noticeable trend towards a growing share of energy consumption derived 
                from low-carbon sources. Renewable energy and natural gas consumption have experienced 
                a significant increase, while the use of energy generated from petroleum, coal, 
                and similar fossil fuels has declined. However, it's important to note that despite 
                these positive shifts, the majority of global energy consumption still originates from non low-carbon methods of production

          <h2>Varying efforts to move away from non-renewable forms of energy</h2>
          <p>
            There is an effort by countries in the higher income groups to move away from non-renewable forms of
             energy. Seen on left, we can see that there is a slight upwards trend in the share of renewable energy in the total energy consumption for every income group
            except for the low income group.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is reinforced by how the efforts to move towards low carbon electricity has been led by higher income countries.
            Low carbon electricity is classified as electricity produced from renewable sources or nuclear plants. As seen in the 
            the visualisation, the countries in the upper-middle and high income group have moved towards switching to low carbon electricity while
            the countries in the lower income groups seem to be moving away from the low carbon energy.
